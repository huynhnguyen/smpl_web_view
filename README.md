# Work on progress 3D model reconstruction

Based on [Fork](https://github.com/Dene33/hmr) of [End-to-end Recovery of Human Shape and Pose](https://github.com/akanazawa/hmr)

Requires the SMPL model (`.pkl` file format):
```
wget https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kanazawa/cachedir/hmr/models.tar.gz && tar -xf models.tar.gz
```

Todo:

- human motion from video to .bvh and THREE.js render
